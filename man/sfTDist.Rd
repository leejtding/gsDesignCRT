\title{t-distribution Spending Function}
\usage{
sfTDist(alpha, t, param)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{Real value \eqn{> 0} and no more than 1. Normally,
\code{alpha=0.025} for one-sided Type I error specification or
\code{alpha=0.1} for Type II error specification. However, this could be set
to 1 if for descriptive purposes you wish to see the proportion of spending
as a function of the proportion of sample size/information.}

\item{t}{A vector of points with increasing values from 0 to 1, inclusive.
Values of the proportion of sample size/information for which the spending
function will be computed.}

\item{param}{In the three-parameter specification, the first paramater (a)
may be any real value, the second (b) any positive value, and the third
parameter (df=degrees of freedom) any real value 1 or greater. When
\code{gsDesignCRT()} is called with a t-distribution spending function, this
is the parameterization printed.  The five parameter specification is
\code{c(t1,t2,u1,u2,df)} where the objective is that the resulting
cumulative proportion of spending at \code{t} represented by \code{sf(t)}
satisfies \code{sf(t1)=alpha*u1}, \code{sf(t2)=alpha*u2}. The t-distribution
used has \code{df} degrees of freedom.  In this parameterization, all the
first four values must be between 0 and 1 and \code{t1 < t2}, \code{u1 <
u2}.  The final parameter is any real value of 1 or more. This
parameterization can fit any two points satisfying these requirements.  The
six parameter specification attempts to fit 3 points, but does not have
flexibility to fit any three points.  In this case, the specification for
\code{param} is c(t1,t2,t3,u1,u2,u3) where the objective is that
\code{sf(t1)=alpha*u1}, \code{sf(t2)=alpha*u2}, and \code{sf(t3)=alpha*u3}.
See examples to see what happens when points are specified that cannot be
fit.}

\value{
An object of type \code{spendfn}. See

\description{
The function \code{sfTDist()} provides perhaps the maximum
flexibility among spending functions provided in the \code{gsDesignCRT}
package. This function allows fitting of three points on a cumulative
spending function curve; in this case, six parameters are specified
indicating an x and a y coordinate for each of 3 points.

The t-distribution spending function takes the form \deqn{f(t;\alpha)=\alpha
F(a+bF^{-1}(t))} where \eqn{F()} is a cumulative t-distribution function
with \code{df} degrees of freedom and \eqn{F^{-1}()} is its inverse.
