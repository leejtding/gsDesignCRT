\arguments{
\item{k}{Number of analyses planned, including interim and final.}

\item{outcome_type}{\code{1=}continuous difference of means
\cr \code{2=}binary difference of proportions}

\item{test_type}{\code{1=} early stopping for efficacy only
\cr \code{2=} early stopping for binding futility only
\cr \code{3=} early stopping for non-binding futility only
\cr \code{4=} early stopping for either efficacy or binding futility
\cr \code{5=} early stopping for either efficacy or non-binding futility}

\item{test_sides}{\code{1=} one-sided test \cr \code{2=} two-sided test}

\item{size_type}{\code{1=}clusters per arm \cr \code{2=}cluster size}

\item{timing_type}{\code{1=} maximum and expected sample sizes based on
specified information fractions in \code{info_timing}; recruit according to
design specified in \code{recruit_type}
\cr \code{2=} maximum sample size based on specified information fractions
in \code{info_timing} and expected sample sizes based on specified sample
size fractions in \code{m_timing} and \code{n_timing}
\cr \code{3=} maximum and expected sample sizes based on specified
sample size fractions in \code{m_timing} and \code{n_timing}
@param recruit_type \code{1=}recruit clusters with fixed sizes
\cr \code{2=}recruit individuals into fixed number of clusters
\cr \code{3=}recruit at both cluster and individual levels}

\item{delta}{Effect size for theta under alternative hypothesis. Must be > 0.}

\item{sigma_vec}{Standard deviations for control and treatment groups
(continuous case).}

\item{p_vec}{Probabilities of event for control and treatment groups
(binary case).}

\item{rho}{Intraclass correlation coefficient. Default value is 0.}

\item{alpha}{Type I error, default value is 0.05.}

\item{beta}{Type II error, default value is 0.1 (90\% power).}

\item{m}{Number of clusters for finding maximum mean cluster size. If
\code{m} is a scalar, it is treated as the total number of clusters across
arms. If \code{m} is a vector of length 2, it is treated as the number of
clusters per arm.}

\item{m_alloc}{Allocation ratio of clusters per arm. Default is
\code{c(0.5, 0.5)}.}

\item{n}{Mean cluster size for finding maximum number of clusters. If
\code{n} is a scalar, it is treated as the average cluster size for both
arms. If \code{n} is a vector of length 2, it is treated as the average
cluster size per arm.}

\item{n_cv}{Coefficient of variation for cluster size. If \code{n_cv} is a
scalar, it is treated as the coefficient of variation for both arms. If
\code{n_cv} is a vector of length 2, it is treated as the coefficient of
variation per arm.}

\item{info_timing}{Sets timing of interim analyses based on information
fractions. Default of 1 produces analyses at equal-spaced increments.
Otherwise, this is a vector of length \code{k} or \code{k-1}. The values
should satisfy \code{0 < info_timing[1] < info_timing[2] < ... <
info_timing[k-1] < info_timing[k]=1}.}

\item{m_timing}{Sets timing of interim analyses based on fractions of the
number of clusters.}

\item{n_timing}{Sets timing of interim analyses based on cluster size}

\item{alpha_sf}{A spending function or a character string indicating an
upper boundary type (that is, \dQuote{WT} for Wang-Tsiatis bounds,
\dQuote{OF} for O'Brien-Fleming bounds, and \dQuote{Pocock} for Pocock
bounds). The default value is \code{sfLDOF} which is a Lan-DeMets
O'Brien-Fleming spending function. See details,
\code{vignette("SpendingFunctionOverview")}, manual and examples.}

\item{alpha_sfpar}{Real value, default is \eqn{-4} which is an
O'Brien-Fleming-like conservative bound when used with a
Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function. This is a real-vector for many spending
functions. The parameter \code{alpha_sfpar} specifies any parameters needed
for the spending function specified by \code{alpha_sf}; this will be ignored
for spending functions (\code{sfLDOF}, \code{sfLDPocock}) or bound types
(\dQuote{OF}, \dQuote{Pocock}) that do not require parameters.}

\item{beta_sf}{A spending function or a character string indicating an
lower boundary type (that is, \dQuote{WT} for Wang-Tsiatis bounds,
\dQuote{OF} for O'Brien-Fleming bounds, and \dQuote{Pocock} for Pocock
bounds). The default value is \code{sfLDOF} which is a Lan-DeMets
O'Brien-Fleming spending function. See details,
\code{vignette("SpendingFunctionOverview")}, manual and examples.}

\item{beta_sfpar}{Real value, default is \eqn{-4} which is an
O'Brien-Fleming-like conservative bound when used with a
Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function. This is a real-vector for many spending
functions. The parameter \code{beta_sfpar} specifies any parameters needed
for the spending function specified by \code{beta_sf}; this will be ignored
for spending functions (\code{sfLDOF}, \code{sfLDPocock}) or bound types
(\dQuote{OF}, \dQuote{Pocock}) that do not require parameters.}

\item{tol}{Tolerance for error (default is 0.000001). Normally this will not
be changed by the user.  This does not translate directly to number of
digits of accuracy, so use extra decimal places.}

\item{r}{Integer value controlling grid for numerical integration as in
Jennison and Turnbull (2000); default is 18, range is 1 to 80.  Larger
values provide larger number of grid points and greater accuracy.  Normally
\code{r} will not be changed by the user.}
