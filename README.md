# gsDesignCRT

The gsDesignCRT package supports group sequential cluster randomized trial design,
largely as presented in the book Group Sequential Methods with Applications to 
Clinical Trials by Christopher Jennison and Bruce Turnbull 
(Chapman and Hall/CRC, 2000) and implemented in the package gsDesign 
(Anderson, 2024).
