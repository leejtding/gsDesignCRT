# Compute stopping boundaries, maximum sample size, and expected sample sizes for a group sequential cluster randomized trial.

`gsDesignCRT()` is used to determine the maximum sample size needed for
a specified parallel group sequential cluster randomized trial to detect
a clinically meaningful effect size with some Type I error rate and
power. Code adapted from gsDesign package.

```

## Arguments

- k:

  Number of analyses planned, including interim and final.

- outcome_type:

  `1=`continuous difference of means  
  `2=`binary difference of proportions

- test_type:

  `1=` early stopping for efficacy only  
  `2=` early stopping for binding futility only  
  `3=` early stopping for non-binding futility only  
  `4=` early stopping for either efficacy or binding futility  
  `5=` early stopping for either efficacy or non-binding futility

- test_sides:

  `1=` one-sided test  
  `2=` two-sided test

- size_type:

  `1=`clusters per arm  
  `2=`cluster size

- timing_type:

  `1=` maximum and expected sample sizes based on specified information
  fractions in `info_timing`; recruit according to design specified in
  `recruit_type`  
  `2=` maximum sample size based on specified information fractions in
  `info_timing` and expected sample sizes based on specified sample size
  fractions in `m_timing` and `n_timing`  
  `3=` maximum and expected sample sizes based on specified sample size
  fractions in `m_timing` and `n_timing` @param recruit_type `1=`recruit
  clusters with fixed sizes  
  `2=`recruit individuals into fixed number of clusters  
  `3=`recruit at both cluster and individual levels

- delta:

  Effect size for theta under alternative hypothesis. Must be \> 0.

- sigma_vec:

  Standard deviations for control and treatment groups (continuous
  case).

- p_vec:

  Probabilities of event for control and treatment groups (binary case).

- rho:

  Intraclass correlation coefficient. Default value is 0.

- alpha:

  Type I error, default value is 0.05.

- beta:

  Type II error, default value is 0.1 (90% power).

- m:

  Number of clusters for finding maximum mean cluster size. If `m` is a
  scalar, it is treated as the total number of clusters across arms. If
  `m` is a vector of length 2, it is treated as the number of clusters
  per arm.

- m_alloc:

  Allocation ratio of clusters per arm. Default is `c(0.5, 0.5)`.

- n:

  Mean cluster size for finding maximum number of clusters. If `n` is a
  scalar, it is treated as the average cluster size for both arms. If
  `n` is a vector of length 2, it is treated as the average cluster size
  per arm.

- n_cv:

  Coefficient of variation for cluster size. If `n_cv` is a scalar, it
  is treated as the coefficient of variation for both arms. If `n_cv` is
  a vector of length 2, it is treated as the coefficient of variation
  per arm.

- info_timing:

  Sets timing of interim analyses based on information fractions.
  Default of 1 produces analyses at equal-spaced increments. Otherwise,
  this is a vector of length `k` or `k-1`. The values should satisfy
  `0 < info_timing[1] < info_timing[2] < ... < info_timing[k-1] < info_timing[k]=1`.

- m_timing:

  Sets timing of interim analyses based on fractions of the number of
  clusters.

- n_timing:

  Sets timing of interim analyses based on cluster size

- alpha_sf:

  A spending function or a character string indicating an upper boundary
  type (that is, “WT” for Wang-Tsiatis bounds, “OF” for O'Brien-Fleming
  bounds, and “Pocock” for Pocock bounds). The default value is `sfLDOF`
  which is a Lan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming spending function. See details,
  [`vignette("SpendingFunctionOverview")`](https://leejtding.github.io/gsDesignCRT/articles/SpendingFunctionOverview.md),
  manual and examples.

- alpha_sfpar:

  Real value, default is \\-4\\ which is an O'Brien-Fleming-like
  conservative bound when used with a Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending
  function. This is a real-vector for many spending functions. The
  parameter `alpha_sfpar` specifies any parameters needed for the
  spending function specified by `alpha_sf`; this will be ignored for
  spending functions (`sfLDOF`, `sfLDPocock`) or bound types (“OF”,
  “Pocock”) that do not require parameters.

- beta_sf:

  A spending function or a character string indicating an lower boundary
  type (that is, “WT” for Wang-Tsiatis bounds, “OF” for O'Brien-Fleming
  bounds, and “Pocock” for Pocock bounds). The default value is `sfLDOF`
  which is a Lan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming spending function. See details,
  [`vignette("SpendingFunctionOverview")`](https://leejtding.github.io/gsDesignCRT/articles/SpendingFunctionOverview.md),
  manual and examples.

- beta_sfpar:

  Real value, default is \\-4\\ which is an O'Brien-Fleming-like
  conservative bound when used with a Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending
  function. This is a real-vector for many spending functions. The
  parameter `beta_sfpar` specifies any parameters needed for the
  spending function specified by `beta_sf`; this will be ignored for
  spending functions (`sfLDOF`, `sfLDPocock`) or bound types (“OF”,
  “Pocock”) that do not require parameters.

- tol:

  Tolerance for error (default is 0.000001). Normally this will not be
  changed by the user. This does not translate directly to number of
  digits of accuracy, so use extra decimal places.

- r:

  Integer value controlling grid for numerical integration as in
  Jennison and Turnbull (2000); default is 18, range is 1 to 80. Larger
  values provide larger number of grid points and greater accuracy.
  Normally `r` will not be changed by the user.
